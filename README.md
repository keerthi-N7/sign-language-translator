# sign-language-translator
This is a Python project that uses machine learning to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers. The model is trained on four basic gestures: Hello, Goodbye, Yes, and No. It can be further expanded to recognize additional signs, making it more versatile.

The system continuously improves its accuracy by collecting real-time data and training the model with user input. This project aims to create a seamless communication experience between sign language users and those unfamiliar with it.
